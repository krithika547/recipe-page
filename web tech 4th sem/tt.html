                        <h5 class="card-title">Do Eggs Really Need To Be at Room Temperature for Baking?</h5>
                        <p class="text-muted">Many baking recipes start with what's called the creaming method. It's when solid fat (often butter) is beaten with sugar to incorporate air. Adding cold eggs to that creamed mixture can influence the texture and lightness of final bake, especially when it’s a batter made with the creaming method.

                            “Cold eggs cause the butter to harden,” says Olivia McCoy, trained pastry chef and head chef of Daily Chew in Atlanta. And hardened butter can't hold any of the tiny air bubbles you're trying to beat in.
                            
                            Ingredients with different temperatures don't always mix well and can lead to dense bakes. “When you mix cold eggs into a mixture with high-fat content, such as butter, it will cause the fats to coagulate and clump up, and appear curdled,” says Norma Salazar, chef-instructor of Pastry & Baking Arts at the Institute of Culinary Education.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">In addition to an extremely hot cast iron pan, you’ll also want to use a non-waxy potato such as a Russet or Yukon Gold. According to my close friend, who has worked in kitchens for years, the potatoes should be quartered and then chopped into smaller cubes. Use a rough chop for this step, as precision isn't necessary.

                            “That's the beauty of breakfast potatoes,” my buddy says, “they are supposed to be quick to make and have a nice play on texture.”</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">You Should Be Freezing Your Watermelon, According to a Food Editor</h5>
                        <p class="text-muted">I am a big fan of frozen fruit. I always have big bags of berries, mango, and pineapple tucked in my freezer for smoothies and desserts, and I regularly buy a dozen bananas, let them turn spotty, then peel and freeze them.

                            While you can use frozen fruit for a whole host of things—baked goods, drinks, fruit salads, and more—some are best used for specific applications and don’t fare well after thawing. This is especially true with watermelon, and that’s why you don’t tend to see the melon in the frozen aisle of the supermarket.
                            
                            You can freeze watermelon, but you’ll want to follow some key steps and use the frozen fruit for specific things. Luckily, those things are delicious and may make you rethink watermelon altogether.</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Luzianne Shares the Secret for Making the Best Iced Tea</h5>
                        <p class="text-muted">First, let's talk about ratios. “The best brewing practice is eight ounces of water per single-serving tea bag,” explains Gay. So start there, then heat up your water and pour it over your tea bag(s). General brewing time, suggests Gay, is three to five minutes for black and herbal tea and three to four minutes for green tea. 

                            If you like stronger tea, you can achieve a bolder brew by steeping the tea bag longer. “That being said,” warns Gay, “if you steep for too long, the tea can become bitter, so I would also suggest adding another bag and steeping for three to four minutes.” It’s best to increase the tea bag-to-water ratio rather than increasing the steeping time.  
                            
                            “The tea should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator soon after brewing,” says Gay, “I use a half-gallon glass Ball jar with a lid.” If you’re looking to make a bigger batch, any vessel will work as long as it’s covered with plastic wrap or an airtight lid. </p>
